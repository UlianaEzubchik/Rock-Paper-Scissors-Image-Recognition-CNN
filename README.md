## Introduction

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Data Collection**: The training and testing data for the model are downloaded from an online dataset containing images of hand gestures for rock, paper, and scissors.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The images are preprocessed using techniques such as rescaling, rotation, and augmentation to enhance the model's ability to generalize.

3. **Model Training**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture comprises several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and fully connected layers.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated using a separate validation dataset to assess its performance in classifying hand gestures.
